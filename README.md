3. **Installing Requirements**
    We need to install the packages for this project.
    We defined all the dependencies in this course using the [standard `requirements.txt` file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).
    You will find this file in the same directory as this readme.
    You can install all the requirements at the same time using this file.

    We recommend you use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.
    You are free to choose whatever system works best for you (like [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)).

    To install the requirements in `requirements.txt` with pip, you can use:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the code**
    We have the code for the project in two formats: The `.py` format and the `.ipynb` format.
    
    Head inside the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    cd src
    ```

    - **To run the .py file:**
